# 3E.Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

##  Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

##  Program
```
t = eval(input())
n_not_exists = 'n' not in t
eight_exists = '8' in t
print(n_not_exists)
print(eight_exists)

```

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
